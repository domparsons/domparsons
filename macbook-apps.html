			<h2>What's on my MacBook?</h2>
			<img src="images/macbook-apps.jpg" class="tile-image" width="100%">
			<h3>Notion</h3>
			<p>If I were to describe Notion in 3 words, I would say: simple, collaborative and powerful. </p>
			<p>At first glance, notion just looks like a simplistic version of word, where you can easily type down notes, but when you start to look around it, you find a whole load of incredible features. </p>
			<p>Notion review coming soon...</p>
			<p>I personally use Notion in a way which does not take advantage of all the features, as I don't have a great need for it, but I have experimented with building databases and other stuff.</p>
			<p>I mainly use it for typing up notes I make in GoodNotes on my iPad. I like to review my notes after lessons so I can solidify my understanding and the typed notes also benefit my revision, specifically for economics and computer science. </p>
			<p>After I hand write my notes in lessons, I type up everything with a little added context, which checks my understanding and expands on what I have learned. I use the toggle feature on Notion to write myself questions based on the notes I made, hiding the answer underneath the toggle. This is a revision technique called active recall, which has proven to be one of the best revision techniques. </p>
			<p>Active recall involves retrieving information from memory, which would otherwise most likely be forgotten. It strengthens the ability to recall the information on a later date (such as an exam).</p>
			<p>I've also started using Notion to write and organise my articles (image below). Down the first column I have a name or an idea that I want to write about, which opens into a whole page with any thoughts or pointers I want to include, followed by the actual article itself. </p>
			<img src="images/notion-ss.png" class="embed-image" width="100%">
			<p>The other columns include: the date I publish the article, the status of the article (idea, in progress, or published), and any content tags, such as technology, podcast review, or general article. Notion allows you to filter and sort by each property. For example, I could filter to only show articles about technology in a certain time frame, or to only show articles with status 'in progress'.</p>
			<p>Notion is also compatible on phones and tablets, so I can easily take notes, add ideas, or read through my lesson notes whenever I like.</p>
			<p>Those are a couple of ways that I use the app, but this is only touching the surface of Notion's capabilities.</p>
			<h3>Alfred 4</h3>
			<p>In a nutshell, Alfred is a more powerful version of MacOS Spotlight. It has some powerful features which supercharge how I use my Mac. Some of the features it has include: </p>
			<ul>
				<li>App search</li>
				<li>Finder and file search</li>
				<li>Inbuilt calculator</li>
				<li>Spelling and definitions</li>
			</ul>
			<p>The benefit of Alfred is that the speed at which it searches through files is incredible. It also remembers which files and apps you use more often and positions them higher up on the search list so you can open whatever you want as quickly as you can think about it. </p>
			<img src="images/alfred-ss.png" class="embed-image" width="100%">
			<p>I use Google Drive to back up all my files, which I have mapped into my Finder, so I never have to click through loads of folders to find that one file.</p>
			<p>Another feature which I have recently discovered is the ability to press shift over a file when selecting from the search results, to show a preview of the file. This is especially useful for PDFs to check you are opening the correct file or just wanted to take a quick glance.</p>
			<h3>Spotify and Podcasts</h3>
			<p>Sometimes I use Spotify or the Apple Podcasts app on my MacBook instead of my phone because there are less distractions and notifications. By turning my phone off I can focus on the work I am doing without wanting to check my phone.</p>
			<p>I listen to music when I want to focus on something difficult, and podcasts when focusing on something slightly easier. Some of a favourite podcasts are: <a href="https://notoverthinking.com" target="_blank" class="decoration"> Not Overthinking</a>, <a href="https://freakonomics.com/nsq/" target="_blank" class="decoration">No Stupid Questions</a>, <a href="https://freakonomics.com" target="_blank" class="decoration">Freakonomics</a> and <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/waveform-the-mkbhd-podcast/id1474429475" target="_blank" class="decoration">Waveform</a>.</p>
			<h3>Sublime Text and Google Chrome</h3>
			<p>When editing or building websites, I use Sublime Text, along with Google Chrome. Chrome has great development features, allowing you to view the webpage with a responsive resolution, or specifically changing the resolution or certain popular devices, such as iPad, Google Pixel, and iPhone X.  This is extremely useful as I can on the fly see how the website looks and behaves while editing, without having to upload the changes and check them frequently.</p>
			<p>Sublime Text is a text editor which is very simplistic in design, with a few features which I personally find useful. Sublime has a few different colour schemes to choose from. One of my favourite features is typing 'lorem' + tab, for the text editor to automatically generate the 'lorem ipsum' paragraph, which makes creating a paragraph while developing super easy.</p>
			<h3>Safari</h3>
			<p>Recently I have switched over to Safari for browsing and watching videos on my Mac. Chrome is much less battery and power efficient, and Safari is much faster and smoother and has a lot more features which I have found very useful (excluding the web development features).</p>
			<p>My favourite feature of Safari is the password manager and generator. When signing up to anything, or changing your password, Safari automatically suggests a 20 character strong password, and stores it to iCloud so it works seamlessly with your other Apple devices. It generates a different password for every website or service, which provides maximum security, and you can simply visit Safari preferences on your Mac, (or Settings on iOS) to find or copy your password.</p>
