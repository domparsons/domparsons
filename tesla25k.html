			<h2>Tesla are making a $25,000 car?</h2>
			<img src="images/model3.jpg" class="tile-image" width="100%">
			<p>The electric car company had a fantastic year in 2020, delivering around 36% more cars than in 2019, benefited by the addition of the Model Y in March. In total, 500 thousand cars were delivered mostly consisting of Model 3 and Model Y which come in significantly cheaper than Tesla's more expensive Model X and Model S, however the Tesla lineup could see a change most likely in the next few years due to an unveil of a $25,000 car.</p>
			<p>In an interview with tech YouTuber Marques Brownlee in 2018, Musk explained making a $25,000 car is something the company could do. Musk said " if we work really hard maybe we could do that in 3 years"</p>
			<h3>How are Tesla going to acheive this?</h3>
			<p>Incredibly, they have plans to cut the cost of batteries in half to under $100 per kilowatt hour, while they have also outlined they are devloping a battery which will last 1 million miles. This would allow significantly less frequent car upgrades, meaning one car could last a lifetime.</p>
			<p>Elon Musk's plan all along was to initally create a low volume, expensive car (Tesla Roadster), and then invest that money into a relatively less expensive, higher volume car (Model S) and then invest that money into a less expensive, much higher volume car (Model 3). </p>
