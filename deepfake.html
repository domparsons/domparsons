			<h2>How dangerous is deepfake?</h2>
			<img src="images/deepfake.jpg" class="tile-image" width="100%">
			<h3>What is deepfake?</h3>
			<p>Deep fake is most commonly an image, video or audio designed to impersonate someone. In recent years, it has become increasingly popular and increasingly difficult to tell if it is real or not. </p>
			<p>Buzzfeed teamed up with Jordan Peele in 2018 to share awareness of the possibilities of deepfake by impersonating President Obama. They said, "Moving forward we need to be more vigilant with what we trust from the internet". There are also deepfakes made to impersonate Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, and even The Queen. </p>
			<h3>How does it work?</h3>
			<p>Deep learning, a form of artificial intelligence, is used to create the realistic images and videos.</p>
			<p>Face shots of the person in the original video, as well as face shots of the person wished to be used in the final video, are run through an algorithm called an encoder, which learns similarities of the two faces. </p>
			<p>The images are compressed into common features, before being decoded and recovered individually. To add the new face onto the original video, you simply feed the encoded messages into the wrong decoder.</p>
			<p>The final product may be very difficult to interpret as fake, or very obvious, depending on the level of complexity and effectiveness of the algorithm, however there are usually giveaways.</p>
			<h3>How to tell a deepfake from a real video</h3>
			<p>Most deepfakes lack the ability to account for blinking, since they use images, therefore a deepfake may not show the person to be blinking at all. Bad lip sinking could also giveaway a fake, as well as fine details such as hair, teeth or a patchy skin tone which are much harder to render.</p>
			<p>Since deepfakes are becoming increasingly difficult to find, algorithms are used to spot deepfakes on the internet. Companies such as Facebook, Twitter and Google are investing in technology to detect them.</p>
			<h3>How dangerous could deepfakes become?</h3>
			<p>The inability to detect deepfakes, paired with a high quantity of fake information floating around the web, could lead us to believe whatever is published. The fear is that in the future the technology could be used maliciously to twist the publics or leaders opinions in a negative or biased way.</p>
			<p>Examples of this include an election, by releasing a video of a candidate saying something insensitive to change people's views right before voting, or to make a leader seem as if they are declaring war or launching a nuclear missile on another country.</p>
			<h3>How to prevent chaos</h3>
			<p>We now know the dangers of this technology and how easily it could lead to huge events if not prevented quickly enough. Here are some ways to prevent danger:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Create algorithms which filter video, identify deepfakes with malicious intent, and remove them the public eye as quickly as possible</li>
				<li>Educate the dangers and vulnerabilities of deepfake to the public</li>
				<li>Understand how realistic deepfakes are, and how not everything on the internet is true, even if it seems that way</li>
			</ul>
