			<h2>What's on my iPad?</h2>
			<img src="images/ipad-apps.jpg" class="tile-image" width="100%">
			<p>As I student, the iPad Air 4 is a big part of my workflow, particularly GoodNotes, an iPad note taking app. But I also use the iPad for a lot of other apps which are more relaxing. The big screen is amazing for reading, and iPadOS 14 has loads of great features which make using the iPad really smooth and fun.</p>
			<p>Below are some apps which I use daily when the phone screen is sometimes too small or social media notifications are too distracting.</p>

			<h3>GoodNotes</h3>
			<p>GoodNotes is my most used app on the iPad since a lot of my time is spent doing school work towards my A-Levels.</p> 
			<p>The experience of handwriting on the iPad makes working much more enjoyable and handwriting benefits information retention, as opposed to typing notes, while the ability to upload notes gives the ability to organise content very easily.</p>
			<p>You can read my in-depth GoodNotes review <a href="goodnotes.html" class="decoration">here</a>.</p>

			<h3>Apple News / Financial Times</h3>
			<p>Reading on the iPad is a great experience. I would've included Kindle to the title, but I use Audible for reading books instead. However I read articles on Apple News and The Financial Times. </p>
			<p>I prefer Apple News to any other news sites because you can pick topics to read about rather than going down rabbit holes reading about nonsense. Apple News still covers headlines, but I prefer The Financial Times for this.</p>
			<p>FT has very well written articles on current headlines and, like Apple Music, you can select topics. It is very beneficial for my Economics A-Level as articles are mainly about the economy, politics and technology.</p>

			<h3>Netflix / YouTube / Disney+</h3>
			<p>The 2360x1640-pixel resolution is perfect for watching videos. The device is easy to hold and very portable so great for travelling, and the 11-inch screen is big enough for one or two people to watch from.</p>
			<p>AirPods Pro work really well with Disney+ thanks to Spacial Audio which makes the whole experience much more dynamic and makes you feel so much more immersed in the movie you're watching.</p>

			<h3>Adobe Lightroom</h3>
			<p>I use Adobe Lightroom to edit my photos. I only make small colour changes to images so nothing very intense, but I am interested in photography and would like take more photos travelling and learn how to edit them properly.</p>

			<h3>Spotify / Apple Podcasts</h3>
			<p>When doing school work, listening to music or a podcast helps me to focus better. Music is really good for keeping focused and headphones are helpful for blocking out surrounding sounds. I usually listen to podcasts when doing easier work which requires less focus.</p>
			<p>I sometimes listen to Lo-Fi music without lyrics. Spotify have a really good <a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/37i9dQZF1DWWQRwui0ExPn?si=dr1g3zy2Rfu-r0k0RDI-Iw" class="decoration" target="_blank">Lo-Fi Beats playlist</a> with around 600 songs.</p>
			<p>Some of a favourite podcasts are: <a href="https://notoverthinking.com" target="_blank" class="decoration"> Not Overthinking</a>, <a href="https://freakonomics.com/nsq/" target="_blank" class="decoration">No Stupid Questions</a>, <a href="https://freakonomics.com" target="_blank" class="decoration">Freakonomics</a> and <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/waveform-the-mkbhd-podcast/id1474429475" target="_blank" class="decoration">Waveform</a></p>

			<h3>Google Earth</h3>
			<p>Sometimes even my MacBook struggles with Google Earth due to the 3D imagery and power it requires. The iPad can handle the app very well. You can plan trips or just browse around Earth.</p>
			<p>My favourite feature selects a completely random place in the world. Google Earth then gives you information about that place including any websites to book a visit.</p>

			<h3>Pinterest</h3>
			<p>Pinterest is a kind of social media with 200 billion images called 'pins' with almost any kind of inspiration you can think of including food, creative DIY, and quotes.</p>
			<p>The app works really well on the big iPad screen and makes it easy to fill up my boards. My main board and favourite topic to look at on Pinterest is interior and exterior design.</p>
